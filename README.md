# MCQ Quiz System
This Java-based software system allows an admin to manage a quiz bank by adding multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with 4 options and an answer key, stored in a `quiz.json` file. Students can log in to take a 10-question quiz randomly selected from the quiz bank. The system uses a `users.json` file for authentication, distinguishing between admin and student roles.

## Features

- **Admin Role**: Add SQA-related MCQs to `quiz.json` until 'q' is pressed. The initial quiz bank contains 30 questions.
- **Student Role**: Take a 10-question quiz with random selection from the quiz bank, scoring 1 mark per correct answer (no negative marking).
- **Authentication**: Login via `users.json` with predefined credentials for admin (`Username: admin, Password: 1234`) and student (`username: Maynul, Password: 1234`).

## How to Run

- **Requirements**:
    - JDK 8 or higher
    - `json-simple-1.1.1.jar` (download from [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/))
 
  - **Steps**:
    1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
    2. Add `json-simple-1.1.1.jar` to your projectâ€™s classpath.
    3. Open in an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ) 
    4. Run the main class: `JavaQuizExam.java`

## Project Structure

- **`src/main/java/JavaQuizExam.java`**: Main Java file containing the quiz system logic.
- **`src/main/resources/users.json`**: Stores user credentials.
- **`src/main/resources/quiz.json`**: Stores the quiz bank with 30 initial SQA questions.
- **`.gitignore`**: Excludes `.idea`, `.gradle`, `gradle`, and `build` files/folders.

## Notes
